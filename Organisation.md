# Collaboration practices 
- ERD, planning and design decisions created collaboratively to develop shared project understanding, but implementation done individually 
- weekly meetings were held with code discussion, help & task allocation  
- all code was reviewed through pull requests
- Github Issues & discord were used for ongoing idea discussions & updates 

Please reference open issues to understand the full scope of our planning & collaboration, and closed issues for our independent task allocation.

# Explanation of Domain Design Choices 
 The Concert class represents a concert event, with fields for title, image name, blurb, and dates, along with a many-to-many relationship with Performer class. The Performer class represents an artist performing at a concert, with fields for name, image name, genre, and blurb, along with a many-to-many relationship with Concert class. <br><br>
 ### Fields & data types:
#### Concert and performers: 
Both classes utilize various data types such as String, Enum (Genre), LocalDateTime, and Sets for storing data related to concerts and performers respectively
#### Booking and seat:
As with all classes, fields align to DTO. Checking the status of isBooked is done with a boolean at the domain layer & with the enum in the resource class. 

### Unique identifiers & class relationships:
#### Concert and performers: 
Both Concert and Performer classes use a Long Id as a unique identifier, and they establish a many-to-many relationship with each other through a join table named "CONCERT_PERFORMER".

#### Booking and seat
Booking has a many-to-one bidirectional relationship with user & a one-to-many bidirectional relationship with seats. Concert is joined to Booking unidirectionally with concert id.
Both classes use a Long Id as a unique identifier.

### Use of Lazy Loading, Eager Fetching, Cascading
#### Concert and performers: 
In the Concert class, lazy loading is applied by default for the Set of Performers, meaning that Performer objects associated with a Concert will be loaded only when explicitly accessed. Otherwise, it is just the proxy of a performer object that is loaded.  Cascading is applied for persisting and deleting Concert-Performer relationships, ensuring that changes to Concert or Performer objects are cascaded to the join table "CONCERT_PERFORMER" for persistence. 
#### Booking & Seat
The seat collection has cascade style persist so that changes in booking lead to changes in seats. As seats & booking are always used in conjunct, seats are eager loaded. However, a booking object does not always obtain user, so user is lazy loaded until needed. 
When a booking is created in concertResource, it dynamic eager fetches concert dates to minimise queries - optimising performance which is necessary for our concurrency implementation. 


# Strategy used to minimise the chance of concurrency errors
- Pessimistic locking when creating bookings and loading seats was used because the locks with exclusive access prevents other concurrent transactions from accessing the same resource concurrently, particularly when conflicts are frequent. The conflict of double-booking the same seats is highly expected when lots of users use the service.
  
- Optimistic locking for logging in users was used because there is a low chance of conflicts (user's credentials won't be changed that frequently) and this approach enables concurrent access to a shared resource (the Users table), unlike Pessimistic locking. This means that when there are a lot of users, the system concurrency is efficient. 


# Other design decisions 
- We've created an additional class (not part of the domain model): ConcertInfoSubscription, to store the subscription response and the threshold of seats booked to notify subscribers.
- We used Publish/Subscribe asynchronous communication because multiple 'clients' are subscribed to the server (multiple subscription requests), and the server must publish messages to them (notifications), so messaging may be frequent (so not Server-side push) and there won't be long-running tasks (so not Priority scheduling).


These decisions all lead to **scalability** as our choice of locking ensures that concurrency issues are minimised when there are a lot of requests and the way we mitigate Lazy Loading and Eager Fetching ensures that the system can efficiently return a lot of records (while the system scales up).
